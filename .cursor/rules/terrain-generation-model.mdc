## Core Components

### State-Specific Elevation Profiles
- Models elevation data for 14 distinct AT states
- Implements multi-frequency sine wave generation for terrain modeling
- Maintains accurate elevation ranges per state
- Creates realistic peak/valley distributions matching actual trail characteristics

### Geographic Accuracy System
Located in `src/data_loader.py`:
- Generates authentic terrain patterns based on real AT characteristics
- Ensures proper state sequencing and mileage accuracy
- Maintains elevation authenticity within state-specific ranges
- Models natural terrain transitions between states

### Key Terrain Generation Rules
1. Elevation Range Compliance
- Each state's generated terrain must stay within documented elevation bounds
- Peak/valley ratios match historical trail data
- Natural elevation transitions at state boundaries

2. Terrain Pattern Authenticity
- Multi-frequency wave combinations for realistic mountain profiles
- State-specific terrain characteristic modeling
- Geographic accuracy validation for generated segments

Importance Score: 90/100
- Critical for accurate trail representation
- Core domain-specific implementation
- Essential for hiking time and difficulty calculations
- Direct impact on business value through authentic terrain modeling
