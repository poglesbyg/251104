## Data Generation → Analysis → Visualization Flow

1. Terrain Generation (src/data_loader.py)
- Generates realistic AT terrain profiles using multi-frequency sine waves
- Models state-specific elevation characteristics
- Outputs geographic data matching 14 AT states

2. Analysis Processing (src/analysis.py)
- Processes terrain data through difficulty classification
- Computes state-by-state trail statistics
- Applies hiking time calculations using Naismith's rule variants
- Generates section difficulty metrics

3. Visualization Output (src/visualization.py)
- Renders elevation profiles with state boundaries
- Creates difficulty distribution visualizations
- Produces comparative state metrics
- Generates interactive elevation-colored trail maps

## Key Data Transformations

1. Raw Terrain → Analyzed Metrics
- Elevation data → Grade percentages
- Grade data → Difficulty categories (Easy to Extreme)
- Distance/elevation → Estimated hiking times
- 5-mile windows → Section difficulty ratings

2. Analysis Results → Visual Components
- Difficulty metrics → Distribution charts
- State statistics → Comparative visualizations
- Elevation/grade data → Color-coded trail maps

## Component Integration Points

1. Data Loader → Analysis
- Elevation profile handoff
- State boundary markers
- Geographic accuracy validation

2. Analysis → Visualization
- Difficulty category mapping
- State-specific metrics transfer
- Section analysis results

Importance Score: 85/100

Primary data flow components that transform terrain data through analysis to visualization:

1. Terrain Data Generation → Analysis → Visualization
   - `src/data_loader.py` generates synthetic trail data with elevation profiles
   - `src/analysis.py` processes elevation data for difficulty metrics  
   - Terrain characteristics flow through state-by-state analysis

2. Daylight Analysis Pipeline
   - Solar calculations based on trail latitude progression
   - Daylight window data transforms into hiking pace constraints
   - `src/daylight_analysis.py` outputs optimized hiking schedules

3. Speed Record Analysis Flow
   - Raw elevation data feeds into FKT pace requirements
   - `src/fkt_analysis.py` transforms terrain data into sustainable speed metrics
   - Outputs elevation gain distribution analysis

Core Data Transformations:
- Raw elevation data → Grade difficulty classifications (5-level system)
- Geographic coordinates → Daylight availability windows
- Trail segments → Terrain-specific pace requirements
- State boundaries → Regional elevation profiles

Data Dependencies:
1. Trail Data Generation feeds elevation profiles to:
   - Grade difficulty analysis
   - Daylight calculations
   - FKT analysis

2. Analysis outputs connect to:
   - Daylight-constrained hiking calculations
   - Speed record feasibility metrics
   - State-specific trail characteristics

Importance Score: 90/100
Critical for transforming raw terrain data into actionable trail metrics
