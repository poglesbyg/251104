# data-flow-pipeline

## Data Generation → Analysis → Visualization Flow

1. Terrain Generation (src/data_loader.py)
- Generates realistic AT terrain profiles using multi-frequency sine waves
- Models state-specific elevation characteristics
- Outputs geographic data matching 14 AT states

2. Analysis Processing (src/analysis.py)
- Processes terrain data through difficulty classification
- Computes state-by-state trail statistics
- Applies hiking time calculations using Naismith's rule variants
- Generates section difficulty metrics

3. Visualization Output (src/visualization.py)
- Renders elevation profiles with state boundaries
- Creates difficulty distribution visualizations
- Produces comparative state metrics
- Generates interactive elevation-colored trail maps

## Key Data Transformations

1. Raw Terrain → Analyzed Metrics
- Elevation data → Grade percentages
- Grade data → Difficulty categories (Easy to Extreme)
- Distance/elevation → Estimated hiking times
- 5-mile windows → Section difficulty ratings

2. Analysis Results → Visual Components
- Difficulty metrics → Distribution charts
- State statistics → Comparative visualizations
- Elevation/grade data → Color-coded trail maps

## Component Integration Points

1. Data Loader → Analysis
- Elevation profile handoff
- State boundary markers
- Geographic accuracy validation

2. Analysis → Visualization
- Difficulty category mapping
- State-specific metrics transfer
- Section analysis results

Importance Score: 85/100
