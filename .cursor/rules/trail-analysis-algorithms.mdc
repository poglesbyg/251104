## Core Analysis Components

### Difficulty Classification Algorithm
- Classifies trail segments using grade percentages:
  * Easy: 0-5% grade
  * Moderate: 5-10% grade
  * Difficult: 10-15% grade
  * Very Difficult: 15-20% grade
  * Extreme: >20% grade

### Hiking Time Estimation
- Custom implementation of Naismith's rule variants
- Factors incorporated:
  * Base speed on flat terrain
  * Elevation gain penalties
  * Descent time adjustments
  * State-specific terrain modifiers

### Section Analysis Methodology
- Uses 5-mile rolling windows for difficulty assessment
- Evaluates terrain characteristics and elevation changes
- Generates composite difficulty metrics for trail sections
- Identifies challenging segments based on multiple factors

### State Statistics Processing
- Calculates state-specific trail metrics
- Processes elevation profiles by state
- Computes difficulty distributions per state
- Generates comparative state-level analysis

## Implementation Location

Primary algorithms located in:
- src/analysis.py
- src/main_analysis.py

Importance Score: 90/100
Rationale: Core domain-specific algorithms that directly implement unique trail analysis business logic
