- Terrain-specific elevation gain calculations
- State boundary integration with elevation profiles
Importance Score: 85/100

## Trail Difficulty Distribution
- Specialized algorithms for analyzing terrain challenges
- Integration of elevation data with terrain classification
- Geographic boundary-aware visualization components
Importance Score: 90/100

## Interactive Trail Mapping
- Custom elevation gain distribution analysis
- Trail segment difficulty visualization
- State-specific trail characteristics display
Importance Score: 75/100

Core Implementation Files:
- visualization.py
- arcgis_integration.py

The visualization system prioritizes specialized trail-specific metrics, particularly focusing on elevation changes, difficulty distributions, and geographic boundaries. The implementation emphasizes terrain analysis and trail segment categorization specific to the Appalachian Trail's unique characteristics.
