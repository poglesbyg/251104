# Daylight-Only Hiking Analysis Summary

## Overview

This analysis explores the **critical difference between hiking 24/7 (like the FKT record) vs hiking only during daylight hours** (what most thru-hikers actually do).

## Key Findings

### 🌙 Current FKT Record (24/7 Hiking)
- **Duration**: 40 days, 18 hours, 6 minutes
- **Hiking hours/day**: 20.4 hours
- **Sleep/rest**: Only 4 hours per day
- **Required pace**: 2.39 mph moving pace
- **Night hiking**: Significant hiking in darkness with headlamps

### 🌞 Daylight-Only Hiking Reality

#### If You Tried FKT Pace with Daylight Only:
- **Spring start (April 1)**: Would require 4.44 mph pace (running!)
- **Summer start (June 15)**: Would require 4.08 mph pace (still running!)
- **Feasibility**: Very challenging - ultramarathon runner pace

#### Realistic Daylight-Only Durations:

| Pace | Miles/Day | Duration | Difficulty |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| 2.0 mph | 22.0 | 89 days (3 months) | Moderate |
| 2.5 mph | 26.9 | 73 days (2.4 months) | Fast |
| 3.0 mph | 31.8 | 61 days (2 months) | Fast |
| 3.5 mph | 36.7 | 53 days (1.8 months) | Very Fast |

**Most thru-hikers: 2.0-3.0 mph = 2-3 months**

## Seasonal Impact on Daylight

### Start Month Comparison (150-day thru-hike)

| Start Month | Avg Daylight | Min Daylight | Required Pace |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| **March** ⭐ | 15.0 hours | 12.8 hours | 1.16 mph |
| **April** ⭐ | 15.0 hours | 13.4 hours | 1.16 mph |
| May | 14.5 hours | 11.8 hours | 1.20 mph |
| June | 13.6 hours | 10.3 hours | 1.28 mph |
| July | 12.5 hours | 9.5 hours | 1.39 mph |
| August | 11.5 hours | 9.6 hours | 1.51 mph |

**⭐ Optimal Start**: Mid-March to mid-April for NOBO (Northbound)

### Why March/April is Best:
1. **Maximum daylight hours** as you progress north
2. **Warming weather** - following spring north
3. **Finish before winter** - complete by late summer/early fall
4. **Trail conditions** - snow melting in southern states

## Daylight Hours Along the Trail

### Geographic Variation
- **Georgia (start)**: 34.6°N latitude
- **Maine (end)**: 45.9°N latitude
- **Impact**: Significant latitude change affects daylight duration

### Seasonal Progression
Starting mid-March, progressing ~13 miles/day (150-day pace):
- **Weeks 1-4 (GA→NC→TN)**: 12-14 hours daylight
- **Weeks 5-12 (Virginia)**: 14-15 hours daylight (peak)
- **Weeks 13-20 (Mid-Atlantic)**: 14-16 hours daylight
- **Weeks 21-22 (New England)**: 15-16 hours daylight (summer solstice)

## Practical Implications

### For Planning Your Thru-Hike:

1. **Choose Your Start Date Wisely**
   - NOBO: March 15 - April 15 optimal
   - SOBO: June 15 - July 15 optimal

2. **Set Realistic Daily Mileage**
   - Beginner: 10-15 miles/day
   - Intermediate: 15-20 miles/day
   - Experienced: 20-25 miles/day
   - Very experienced: 25-30 miles/day

3. **Calculate Your Duration**
   - Total miles: ~2,190
   - Your daily average: ____ miles
   - Estimated days: 2,190 ÷ daily average
   - Add 10-20% for zero days/rest

4. **Typical Hiking Day (Daylight-Only)**
   ```
   6:00 AM  - Wake up, breakfast, pack
   7:30 AM  - Start hiking (sunrise ~7:00 AM)
   12:00 PM - Lunch break
   1:00 PM  - Resume hiking
   6:00 PM  - Stop for camp (sunset ~7:00 PM)
   6:00-8:00 PM - Set up camp, dinner
   8:00-10:00 PM - Relax, socialize
   10:00 PM - Sleep
   
   Total hiking: ~9.5 hours
   At 2.5 mph: ~24 miles
   ```

## Comparison Summary

### The FKT Advantage
The 24/7 hiking strategy allows the FKT holder to:
- **Gain 9-10 hours per day** of additional hiking time
- **Hike during coolest hours** (night/early morning)
- **Avoid midday heat** in summer sections
- **Make up time** on easier sections by hiking longer

### The Daylight-Only Advantage
Most thru-hikers prefer daylight-only because:
- **Safety**: Better visibility for navigation and hazards
- **Social**: More interaction with other hikers
- **Recovery**: Proper 7-8 hours sleep for muscle recovery
- **Enjoyment**: See scenery, wildlife, views
- **Sustainability**: Lower injury risk, more sustainable pace

## Calculations Used

### Daylight Hours Formula
Based on solar declination and latitude:
```
daylight_hours = (2 × hour_angle) ÷ 15 + twilight
```

Where:
- Hour angle depends on latitude and day of year
- Twilight adds ~1 hour (civil twilight usable for hiking)

### Required Pace Calculation
```
required_pace = miles_per_day ÷ (daylight_hours × 0.75)
```

The 0.75 factor accounts for:
- Breaks (snacks, water, rest)
- Camp setup/takedown
- Navigation/route finding
- Non-movement time

## Recommendations

### For FKT Attempts:
- ✅ Accept that significant night hiking is required
- ✅ Train for minimal sleep (4-5 hours/day)
- ✅ Practice headlamp navigation
- ✅ Build crew support for resupply
- ✅ Choose optimal weather window

### For Regular Thru-Hikers:
- ✅ Plan for daylight-only hiking (safer, more enjoyable)
- ✅ Start mid-March for NOBO, mid-June for SOBO
- ✅ Target 2-3 mph pace with breaks
- ✅ Expect 90-150 days for completion
- ✅ Allow flexibility for weather/rest days
- ✅ Enjoy the journey, not just the destination!

## Bottom Line

**The FKT is extraordinary precisely because it requires hiking nearly 24/7.** 

For 99.9% of thru-hikers, daylight-only hiking makes much more sense:
- **Safer** and more sustainable
- **More enjoyable** - see the views!
- **Better recovery** - proper sleep
- **Still challenging** - 2-3 months is no joke!

The analysis shows that if you hike during daylight hours only, you should plan for **60-150 days** depending on your pace, with most hikers completing in **4-5 months**. This is perfectly normal and allows you to actually enjoy one of the most beautiful trails in the world! 🏔️
